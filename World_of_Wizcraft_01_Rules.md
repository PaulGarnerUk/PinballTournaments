# World of Wizcraft #

## Setup ##

At the start of the event, each player is randomly assigned between 2 and 5 cards
(by rolling 3 D6. Any 4, 5 or 6 rolled adds one extra card above the two freebies)

The cards you receive can only be played in certain phases of the game. Posters at the event will explain the phases, which should be read sequentially, like a clock as shown below :
[Poster 01 of card phases]

Each card shows which phases the card may be played in. For example, the Steal card shows it can be played in phases 1, 2 or 3 as below : 
[Close up of example card, showing playable phases]

A more detailed explanation of each phase :

### Phase 1 = Pre Game ###
In the pre game phase you will be randomly assigned into groups of four (or three) and a random machine.  You may play cards that can be triggered in phase 1 at this point if you like. Examples would be cards that switch players or machines

### Phase 2 = Game play (balls 1 and 2) ###
You start playing your game. Some cards can be played to affect gameplay. Some of these have an immediate effect, such as FREEZE which means the player must stop playing and drain all the current balls in play.  Each card explains the effect, so as you play it, it’s worth explaining to the other players what the effect is.

### Phase 3 = Last ball ###
Some cards can only be played just prior to player one ball three.  This is the last chance to play cards during the game. Once player 1 ball three has started then no cards can be played until…

### Phase 4 = End of game ###
Some cards will extend the game (add an extra ball or more to someone’s score)
No cards can further affect gameplay if the game is extended this way (This isn’t something you need to know - it’s just there are no cards designed to be triggered that way in this phase)

## Enhance cards ##
These cards can change the effect of the card played immediately prior. Any player can play an Enhance card (so long as they are holding one of course).  In some cases the card will improve the previously played card. In other cases it will add a negative effect, or even change who controls the effect (For example when TELEPORT is played, by default a random game is selected, but you or another player can play ENHANCE and choose which game is selected instead).  Each card explains both the default effect and the Enhanced effect, eg:

## At the end of each game: ##

| Placing  | Points | Cards
|---|---|---
| Winner | 7 points | May collect *two* more cards
| Second place | 5 points| May collect one more card
| Third place | 3 points	| May collect one more card
| Fourth place | 0 points | May collect *two* more cards

No player can hold more than 5 cards at any one time. If you have more than 5 cards in hand then you may select which one/s to discard back to the deck

At the end of round, each player may also discard one selected card before drawing a replacement random card from the deck if they choose.

Play continues as long as time allows.  The top four players (after tiebreakers) will play one last FINAL BATTLE to determine the winner.

## FINAL BATTLE ##

Top four players will play a single game to determine the winner.

All players are cured of Plague. All cards are returned to the community deck.

Each player then draws five cards from the deck. After all players have drawn cards, then each player may optionally swap two cards from their hand with random cards from the deck.
In this final phase then the Banish card cannot be played, and should be removed from the deck (or allow players a free replacement if drawn)
