# UK Pinfest Open 2024

This is an IFPA Certified competition, using an unlimited cards ‘best game’ qualifying format. 


## Qualifying

Upon tournament registration the player will start their first tournament card (see Entry Fees below)

A card consists of the player’s choice of any five unique games, from a choice of the 12+ games available in the competition. 

The player must notify a tournament official before starting each game, and the official may place the player in a virtual queue for that game during busy periods. Players may only join the queue for a single game at a time, though the player may request to leave one queue and join another by asking a tournament official.

After completing the game, the player should raise their hand to attract the attention of a tournament official who will register the player’s score. 

The player may instead optionally choose to abandon their card (void it) at this point if the player feels their scores on this card so far are not worth registering. This allows the player a shortcut to start-over on a new card without needing to complete all five games. Only one card can be open against the player at any time. A player must complete or void their card before starting a new one.

Assuming the card is not voided, the player repeats this process to play five unique games and complete their card. Once the card is complete the player's scores on each of the five games are individually compared to other competitor’s attempts on each of the five games. For the player with the top score on each game, 100 points are awarded. For the second placed player 95 points are awarded, then 90 points, 89, 88 and so on.

The points awarded for each individual game on the five game card are then summed to become the card score. It is the player’s card score that is then used to rank the player's position in the tournament.

Screens around the tournament area will show individual game scores that the player can compete against, and the current ranking of all players in the tournament.

Players may rebuy another card and make an unlimited number of attempts during the qualifying period.

Qualifying ends at 6pm on the Saturday, at which points any game in progress may be completed. There is no additional time allowance for players to complete their cards however. Incomplete (or unused) cards will not be refunded.

The top 24 ranked players at the end of the qualifying period continue in the finals. The top 8 players receive a bye to the second round.

### Tiebreaking qualification spots

In cases where two or more players score an identical number of points, then each of the player’s lowest scores on their qualifying card will be dropped and the players card scores then re-compared. (If ties still exist then the fourth lowest score will be dropped and so on). This technique means that the player with a better ‘average’ from the set of qualifying games will be seeded higher.


## Finals

Finals will consist of the top 24 ranked players. The top 8 ranked players will receive a bye past the first round.

Each round of finals will be played in groups of four players, over three games, and each game scoring 4,2,1,0 : 4 points to the winner, 2 for second, 1 for third and 0 for last place.

In each group, the top two players will advance.

Departing players will be ranked based on the score achieved within the group play. Ties amongst departing players will be split based on qualifying position.

### Tiebreaking during finals

Tiebreaking during finals is only relevant to determine the two advancing players, or amongst ties with the highest scores in the final round.  Tied players will play an additional game.  
In the tiebreaking game the highest rank seed will have selection of game or position. The second rank player will then have choice from the remaining options (and so on through any other tied players). The game selected must NOT be a game already played by the group during this round.

### Seeding 

Seeding during finals is based on the qualification place that the player achieved.  After each round, remaining players will be regrouped based on that qualification seed.

#### Round One (24 players, minus byes)

Players will be grouped together based on their qualifying rank, as below

- Group A: 9, 16, 17, 24
- Group B: 10, 15, 18, 23
- Group C: 11, 14, 19, 22
- Group D: 12, 13, 20, 21

#### Round Two: Quarter finals (16 players)

Advancing players will be joined by the top 8 qualifiers. All remaining players are grouped based on qualifying rank, as below

- Group A: 1, 8, 9, 16
- Group B: 2, 7, 10, 15
- Group C: 3, 6, 11, 14
- Group D: 4, 5, 12, 13

#### Round Three: Semi finals (8 players)

Advancing players are regrouped based on qualifying rank as below.

- Group A: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Group B: 2, 3, 6, 7

#### Round Four: Grand final (4 players)

Final four remaining players.

- Group A: 1, 2, 3, 4


### Game selection

Game selection occurs at the start of each round of finals. Each group will pick all three of the games they will play during that round before any games are started, following the process below.

The group containing the highest rank seed will have first choice, followed by the group containing the second highest seed and so on.

In each group, the highest rank seed will have selection of game or position. The second rank player will then have choice from the remaining options and so on through the third and fourth ranked players within the group.  When making a game selection, the group must select a game that has not already been chosen by the group during this round, and must also be a game not already selected by another group in this sequence. Further, each machine may only be selected ONCE per player throughout the entire series of finals games (until the player has selected all of the available games).

This process will be repeated, asking each group to select their first game, then looping back through each group in turn to select the second game, and then a final loop to select the third game.

Once all groups have selected their three games then the round can start. This process of game selection should make it easier for each group to progress to their second (and third) game without waiting for all groups to complete their current game.

For example.
1. Group A picks game Alpha Blasters as their first game in the round.
2. Group B picks Bravo Command as their first game (they cannot select Alpha Blasters)
3. Group C picks Charlie Madness (they cannot select Alpha Blasters or Bravo Command)

<br>

4. Group A picks Delta Wing as their second game in the round
5. Group B picks Alpha Blasters as their second game (they cannot select Delta Wing)
6. Group C picks Echo Pattern (they cannot select Delta Wing or Alpha Blasters)

Etc until all groups have selected all three games for the current round.
